    "EP2219142": "In a further embodiment the reminder window which first pops up a preset time before the conference call event is as shown in FIG.17C.Thus the reminder window includes the Join Now component 1722 at first instance and this component is preselected. Join Now button 1722 functions in the same manner as previously describedin conjunction with Join Now menu items 510 704 716 and 1616 and flow diagram 1300 FIG.13. In an alternate embodiment as shown in FIG.17Cagain Join Now button 1722 is added to the menu 1721 of options in reminder window 1720 a preset time before the conference call event however simultaneously with the addition of Join Now button 1722 the Dismiss button 1724 is deselected and the Join Now button 1722 is preselected. In an alternate embodiment the reminder window which first pops up a preset time before the conference call event is as shown in FIG.17B.Thus the reminder window includes the Join Now component 1722 at first instance but the Dismiss button is preselected.With this embodiment optionally at a later time before the conference call the Join Now button becomes preselected as shown in FIG.17C. Conveniently in both the calendar and reminder window embodiments the attendee is able to initiate joining to conference call from displayed user interface without having to access a detailed view of the conference call event to obtain the dialin number and security code and thereafter manually dialing in and entering the security code. In accordance with the present disclosure as shown in FIG.17B Join Now button 1722 is added to the menu 1721 of options in reminder window 1720 a preset time before the conference call event e.g.five minutes before the conference call is scheduled to start.As illustrated the Dismiss button may remain preselected.However at a later time before the conference call is to starte.g.one minute before the scheduled start of the conferenceas shown in FIG.17C the Dismiss button 1724 may be deselected and the Join Now button 1722 may be preselected.",
    "EP2364007": "By way of further explanation in FIG.4 the depicted method includes reception of a new conference call invitationnotification for example the user at the mobile device also can generate a new call 402.A new calendar entry or reminder corresponding to the datetime of the call is added 404 to a calendar e.g.calendar 230 maintained on device 109.An entry is added 406 to a contact database 235 with a name and potentially other indentifying information for the new call.The calendar entry is linked 408 to the contact database entry.An arrival time for the conference call is monitored 410 by the calendar application.Upon such arrival access information is obtained 412 from the linked contact database entry.The obtained access information is provided 414 to a dialer application which causes device 109 to join the call.Descriptive information obtained 412 from the contact database entry is used to update a display on device 109 with information such as a name for the call.Subsequently information retrieved from the contact entry also is used to update a call log with information including a name for the call 420.The entry in the contacts database can be deleted 422 if the call is a onetime call and can be maintained if the call is to be repeated. In sum this disclosure provides examples of how more detailed and helpful information can be provided for conference calling on devices that have software in which only a phone number is displayed or otherwise available through normal conference call processes.In particular by provision of a contact entry which can be linked to a calendar entry or identified based on identifying information in the calendar entry the contact entry can be used as a repository of information to be displayed or otherwise used during and after the conference call.Also although a phone number was depicted as an example of access information for a conference call other information such as an IP address or another handle by which a service offering the conference call can be accessed.Therefore examples involving usage of technology and other terminology associated with the PSTN does not imply a limitation that any device or method according to this disclosure is limited to usage with the PSTN. FIG.3 depicts a method in which the information storedmanaged with these distinct applications can be used for conference calling.A calendar management process 302 tracks appointments and other events including conference calls that are presently scheduled.Upon determining that a time to join a conference call has arrived access information can be retrieved from one or more of the entry for the conference in the calendar manager and the corresponding entry in the contact manager as will be described two examples are presented corresponding to each approach.The callin number part of the access information is provided to a telephone dialer application along with an access code if required 308 310.In conjunction the contact entry is accessed and information from that contact entry is displayed e.g.information such as a title of the conference.The display can continue while the call continues and upon call completion or for example call failure a call log function records an entry in a call logcorresponding to the call and using information such as the name from the contact entry. FIG.9 depicts an example of what is displayed on display 714 during a conference call.In particular a name of the conference call is displayed 822 during the call.By contrast without accessing the information from the contact entry only a phone number would be displayed or otherwise recorded in a call log. Separate boxes or illustrated separation of functional elements of illustrated systems does not necessarily require physical separation of such functions as communications between such elements can occur by way of messaging function calls shared memory space and so on without any such physical separation.As such functions need not be implemented in physically or logically separated platforms although they are illustrated separately for ease of explanation herein.",
    "EP2360953": "Hence in the process flow of FIG.3 at 1130 AM on March 12 the server sends a Wakeup SMS instruction message to the mobile station 13 to instruct that station to call other party S7.The SMS instruction message includes the telephone number of the other party in this case the number 18882221111 for the telephone 21.The client application for this calling service enables the mobile station to extract the telephone number and initiate a call through the mobile communication network 15 in an otherwise normal manner S8.The application would also cause the mobile station to generate a call alert such as a ring to inform the user of the call.The network would establish a voice call to the telephone 21 for example through the PSTN or other network 19 in the example of FIG.1.If the party using that telephone answers the call then the mobile station user and the other party can communicate audibly via the voice telephone call in a normal manner. The instruction message sent from the server 27 will include an activation or wakeup code.When the SMS message is received at the mobile station 13 the code serves as an indication to that station that the message is not a regular text message for alert and display purposes.The code identifies or maps to an application resident in the mobile station 13 and recognition of the code in the message will cause the mobile station to activate or wakeup that application for execution.In this case the application is a client application for initiating a call through the network 15 to a telephone number contained in the SMS instruction message in this case the telephone number of the telephone 21. As outlined above the mobile station 100 includes a processor and programming stored in the flash memory 114 configures the processor so that the mobile station is capable of performing various desired functions including in this case the functions involved in the call scheduling service.For the procedure of FIG.2 the programming may simply be the regular programming of the mobile station for example that used to enable regular SMS message input and transmission through the network 15 and that used for VoIP communication and related SIP type call setup signaling.In the example of FIGS.3 and 4 however the executable programming stored in the flash memory 114 also includes a program to facilitate the actual call setup in response to the command in the SMS message from the VASP server 27.For discussion of a simple example the program may be a client application 122 for calling another party. In this example rather than signaling both end user devices 13 and 21 the VASP server 25 sends an instruction through the mobile communication network 15 to the users mobile station 13 to cause that station to initiate the scheduled voice call at the scheduled time.The transmission of the instruction could use various types of communication supported by the network 15 and the station 13 but in our example the instructions arrives at the mobile station as an incoming SMS message. FIG.3 a second example of a call scheduling and scheduled call setup procedure.Steps S 1 to S3 in this second example are the same as in the example of FIG.2 however the server 27 uses a different procedure to automatically initiate setup of the voice call between the mobile station 13 and the telephone 21 at the scheduled time. The server 25 would send the message in an appropriate format through the Internet 23 to the gateway 29.The gateway would convert the message to SMPP form if needed and route the message to the SMSC 25.The message would include the MDN of the mobile station 13 as the destination address and based on that address the SMSC and other elements of the mobile communication network 15 would deliver the message content as an SMS message over the air to mobile station 13. The activation or wakeup code in instruction message would point to the application 122 and cause the microprocessor 112 to retrieve that program from memory 114 and begin execution of the program 122.Execution of the program 122 would cause the microprocessor 112 to extract a telephone number contained in the SMS instruction message.Execution of the calling client application 122 by the microprocessor 112 also causes the mobile station 13 to initiate a call through the mobile communication network 15 and to alert the user of the call."
